In addition, I have used the following languages and tools a fair amount:

# Projects

Here are a few projects I am particularly proud of:

* Lunar Lander
  * A Lunar Lander-type game I created from scratch using C# and Monogame.
* Dan's Bagel Shop

    a customer, an employee, a manager, and an owner.

# Interests
