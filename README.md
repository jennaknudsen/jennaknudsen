</a>

A Tetris game I created from scratch using C# and Monogame.
 
* The Tetris AI used in Attract Mode was based on results from Yiyuan Lee's Tetris AI training 
  (training details [here](https://codemyroad.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/tetris-ai-the-near-perfect-player/),
  GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/LeeYiyuan/tetrisai)).
* Game details:
  * Uses the [Original Nintendo scoring system](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Scoring#Original_Nintendo_Scoring_System).
  * Uses [sticky gravity](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Line_clear#Line_clear_gravity) on line clears.
  * New level reached after every 10 line clears.
* Persistent storage for this game stores high scores and control configs between sessions.

### [Cross-Platform CLI Shell](https://github.com/jennaknudsen/cross-platform-cli-environment)

</a>
 
A cross-platform command-line interface I wrote in Java. 

* This shell is designed to work out-of-the-box with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Processes can be ran by name from the command line.
  * The shell checks files in the current directory as well as the system PATH.
* This command shell supports builtins such as `list`, `cd`, and `history`.
* Piping using the `|` symbol is supported between two processes.

### [Lunar Lander](https://github.com/jennaknudsen/cs5410/tree/main/Assn3-LunarLander)

 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennaknudsen/jennaknudsen/main/images/lunar-lander-game.png" width="600" />
</a>

A Lunar Lander game I created from scratch using C# and Monogame. 
 
* Terrain for this game is generated using the [midpoint displacement algorithm](https://bitesofcode.wordpress.com/2016/12/23/landscape-generation-using-midpoint-displacement/).
* The lander's physics are calculated using a real-time physics simulation. 
  * Lander thrust acceleration: 7 m/s^2.
  * Moon's gravity acceleration: -1.62 m/s^2.
* Persistent storage for this game stores high scores and control configs between sessions.

</a>

A website I created with two colleagues for a course project. It simulates a bagel shop from the perspective of 
a customer, an employee, a manager, and an owner. This webpage was created using the Django framework.

* Various actions such as customer/employee account creation, placing an order, adding more inventory stock,
  adding account funds to customer balances, etc. are supported.
  * Customer accounts can be created by anyone, but employee accounts must be created by a manager.
* The client sends various HTTP requests to the Django server, the Django server handles these requests using 
  Python programs, and the server returns a new webpage back to the client.
* This project uses an SQLite database to hold all information for customers, accounts, menu items, etc.

## Interests

I'm always willing to learn new programming languages and frameworks, and right now I am especially interested in learning how to use:

* React
* Angular
* TypeScript
* PHP
* Arduino

Outside of programming and software development, my interests include meal-prepping and playing competitive Super Smash Bros.

## Other Information

I came out as transgender (she/her) and began my social transition in November 2021, so many commits in my GitHub repositories are listed under my deadname. Rest assured, I am the same person now as I was under my deadname—it's not an identical twin who wrote my previous code 😉
