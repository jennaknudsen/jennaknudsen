## About Me

## Projects

Here are a few projects I am particularly proud of:

* [Tetris](https://github.com/jonasknudsen/cs5410/tree/main/FinalProject-Tetris)
  * A Tetris game I created from scratch using C# and Monogame.
* [Lunar Lander](https://github.com/jonasknudsen/cs5410/tree/main/Assn3-LunarLander)
  * A Lunar Lander-type game I created from scratch using C# and Monogame.
* [Dan's Bagel Shop](https://github.com/jonasknudsen/cs3450-7even)
  * A website I created with two colleagues for a course project. It simulates a bagel shop from the perspective of 
    a customer, an employee, a manager, and an owner. This webpage was created using the Django framework.
